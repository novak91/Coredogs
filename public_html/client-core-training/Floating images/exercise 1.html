            Pug, the Page, went to Kennel
            Court, the country box of Mr.
            Fox-Hound, and found that
            sporting character near home,
            wiping his brow after a good
            hunt. His manners were more
            blunt than his teeth, and his
            loud voice could be heard miles
            off. He was called a "jolly dog
            and seldom dined alone. But
            his great delight was the chase
            of a fox; he could then hardly
            give tongue enough to express his joy. After asking
            Pug after Mrs. Blenheim's health, he accepted the
            invitation.

            Florio, the Courier, waited on Mr.
            Barker with his note of invitation.
            Mr. Barker lived in a snug little
            house, in a farmyard, where he had
            the charge of watching over and
            protecting the live stock. He at first
            feared he must decline the invitation,
            but, on second thoughts, he resolved to
            venture; it was not a late dinner, and
            he would manage to get away early.
            Unluckily, his coat was rather the worse
            for wear, but he could boast of a
            handsome collar at any rate,â€”and so
            he accepted.
